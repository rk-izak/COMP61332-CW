    "### Description:\n",
    "* Model: Selection of pretrained architectures. Each model was trained on data found in `data/full/` folder, and their architectures can be seen in `/utils/lstm_models.py`.\n",
    "* Input Sentence: Sentence in the form visible in GUI, where `<e1>ENTITY</e1>` indicates the first entity, and `<e2>ENTITY</e2>` the second entity.\n",
    "* Get Predictions: Outputs predicted relation(s) alongside their confidence for the selected model\n",
    "* Reset Output: Clears the window of previous prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTE: If outputs are printed more than once, try changing the kernel/venv into another one, and reverting. It should fix it.\n",
    "#### NOTE: Using bert-based models might result in efficiency drop, especially running for the first time, as the models need to be downloaded."
