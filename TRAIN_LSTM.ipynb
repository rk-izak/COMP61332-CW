    "* Model: Selection of given architectures. Each model will be trained on data found in `data/full/` folder, and their architectures can be seen in `/utils/lstm_models.py`.\n",
    "* Val Split: Amount of train data to be used for validation using training.\n",
    "* Epochs: Number of epochs to train for.\n",
    "* Batch size: Data batch size.\n",
    "* Trainable Embeddings: Whether to finetune embeddings (works only for GloVe and BERT).\n",
    "* Train Model: Start the training.\n",

    "#### NOTE: If outputs are printed more than once, try changing the kernel/venv into another one, and reverting. It should fix it.\n",
    "#### NOTE: Using bert-based models might result in efficiency drop, especially running for the first time, as the models need to be downloaded."
