    "* Model: Selection of given architectures. Each model was trained on data found in `data/full/` folder, and their architectures can be seen in `/utils/nb_svm_models.py`. If you use Naive Bayes, please use an appropriate `NB Model `and `Feature Types` from any found. If you use `SVM`, `NB Model` has no effect, and ONLY Bert feature types can be used.\n",
    "* Train Model: Start the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTE: If outputs are printed more than once, try changing the kernel/venv into another one, and reverting. It should fix it.\n",
    "#### NOTE: Using bert-based models might result in efficiency drop, especially running for the first time, as the models need to be downloaded."
